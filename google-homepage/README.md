# Googlehomepage

Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage

Difficult Version (optional): Build the Google.com search results page

You should be able to reuse much of your code from before if you started with that project. Again, don’t worry about links to nowhere and forms that won’t submit and hard coding the search results (which you’ll have to do of course), just focus on placement and order of items on the page.
