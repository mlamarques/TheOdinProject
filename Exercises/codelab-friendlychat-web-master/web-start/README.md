# Firebase Web Codelab - Start code

This folder contains the starting code for the [Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

If you'd like to jump directly to the end and see the finished code head to the [web](../web) directory.

## Problem fix
in the authorization Firebase CLI part, run (in bash):
```
firebase login --interactive
```
for associate the app with the Firebase project  (use bash in the web-start folder):
```
firebase use friendlychat-46a91
```
