## What Is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

We can use JSX syntax with React. JSX Prevents Injection Attacks.

When we create Function and Class Components we should always start with a capital letter. Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. “props” (stands for properties).

## Set up

You can run a command for setting up a complete React application for you with *create-react-app* :

[create-react-app repository](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

(name of the project folder: my-first-react-app)

```
npx create-react-app my-first-react-app
```
## Start the project

```
yarn start
```
A new window will open in your browser with the app.

index.js and app.js are the two of the most important files.

## For installing without *create-react-app*
